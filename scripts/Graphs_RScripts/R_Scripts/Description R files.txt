Here are the R scripts for the final report:

****************************
Harvest data- 
Graphs extent and biomass removed for all the scenarios


*********************
RX fire data-
Graphing_Rx_fire_time_AllScenarios_DOD
Graphs of Rx fire extent and biomass removed for all the scenarios

Graphing_Rx_fire_time_DOD
Graphs of Rx fire extent and biomass removed for just a few scenarios, 
Thought this might be useful if we want to simplify the graphs.


*****************************
For the biomass graphs
You first run the script called:
MultipleScenarios_SppMaps.R
Which collects all the biomass maps and calculates a landscape average.

To do, this you'll have to update the look up table called:
Scenarios_071919.csv

where the first column of the csv is the folder for each scenario/simulation.  
The output from that script is a csv file called:
SppBiomass-Summary.csv

This file is used for the graphing scripts, one for total biomass and one for each species.
Graphing_totalBiomass_time_AllScenarios_DOD.R
Graphing_SpeciesBiomass_time_AllScenarios_DOD.R
