# Project-Fort-Bragg-NC

Model inputs for Ft. Bragg simulations of climate change, hurricanes, and management.  This research was funded by the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP)(Project #: RC-201702). The Ft. Bragg Natural Resources Team was instrumental in the development and delivery of this data:  Rod Fleming, Jason Monroe, T. Kevin Crawford.  Project co-PIs include:  Drs. Melissa Lucash, Robert Scheller, and Matthew Duveneck.

The purpose of this repository is to allow fast and efficient reproduction of the results that have been delivered to ESTCP and Ft. Bragg.  Requirements for re-running the models and scenarios include:
* Installation of the LANDIS-II model (see http://www.landis-ii.org/home) and the extensions (see the 'installers' sub-folder)
* Copy all the material in the 'Model Inputs' sub-folder to a local computer.
* Scenario/Simulation extension options incude Succession (NECN or PnET), Fire, Hurricane, and harvest.
* Launch the scenarios using the included batch file.

Analysis of model outputs requires installation of the R statistical package.  Example scripts have been provided in the 'scripts' sub-folder.

Questions and concerns should be directed to Robert Scheller.
