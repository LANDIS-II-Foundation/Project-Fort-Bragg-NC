# Hurricane data

We developed a new extension for LANDIS-II to simulate hurricane disturbances across Ft. Bragg.  The corresponding publication is currently in preparation.

The source code for the new extension is available here:  https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-Base-Hurricane
