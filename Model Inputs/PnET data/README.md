PnET Input data
These data represent the inputs for the PnET-Succession extension for LANDIS-II used in the Fort Bragg landscape.

Important files and file types:

!!_FIRE3_HAD -HURRICANE.bat: This is the batch file that will run the HAD climate future with, BAU fire, hurriances, and harvest.
!!_FIRE3_BCC -HURRICANE.bat: This is the batch file that will run the BCC climate future with, BAU fire, hurriances, and harvest.
Base-Hurricane.txt: This is the BAU hurricane input file used with the base-hurricane extension parameterized for Fort Bragg.
CWD_FortBragg.tif: This is a raster input layer defining the coarse woody debris in g/m2.
C_to_C_helprun.bat: This is a "help run" file that is used by the other batch files to point outputs to output directories.
Climate3-13-2019_pnet.csv: This is a climate input file for static climate (no climate change).
Climate_pnet_climate_static_FortBragg.txt: This is a climate input file for static climaate using the 'classic' PnET climate format.
DisturbanceReductions.txt: This is an input file that defines how much biomass is removed from each disturbance extension.
EcoRegions_FortBragg.txt: This text file defines the ecoregions (soil regions) used by PnET-Succession.
EcoregionParameters_PnET_STATIC_CLIMATE.txt: This text file defines the soil parameters used in PnET-Succession under static climate.
Gereric_parameters_FortBragg.txt: This text file defines the PnET-Succession parameters that stay constant across species.
HARVEST_7_18.txt: This text file defines the BAU harvest regime.
HadGEM2-ES365_r1i1p1_rcp85_Mod.csv: This is a climate input file for the HAD climate (Climate change).
