Here are the input files for LANDIS

The NECN folder has all the files and maps, but the NECN file itself.
The NECN.txt file is in the subfolder for each scenario to make sure it points to the correct climate.txt file.

So when you run a scenario, you'll need to make sure it's running the correct NECN file.
Like here's one called:
NECNSuccession_FortBragg_HighTemp_HighPpt.txt

whereas before it was just called NECNSuccession_FortBragg_v3.txt
