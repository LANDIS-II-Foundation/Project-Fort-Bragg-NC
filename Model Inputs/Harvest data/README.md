# Harvest data

Model inputs for Ft. Bragg simulations of harvesting, via a library of the Biomass Harvest extension:  http://www.landis-ii.org/extensions/biomass-harvest

This unique library (see the installers sub-directory) allows stands to be ranked by biomass with a minimum biomass for removal.
