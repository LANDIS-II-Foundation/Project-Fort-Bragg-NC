# Model Inputs

This folder contains the input files for the LANDIS-II model for the Ft. Bragg simulations.  There are two primary models within LANDIS-II that were simulated:  NECN (http://www.landis-ii.org/extensions/net-ecosystem-cn-succession) and PnET (http://www.landis-ii.org/extensions/pnet-succession).  Within each of these sub-folders is a batch file (.bat) that will run a full scenario, including fire, harvesting, and hurricanes.  

Before running a scenario, the model must be installed.  See the 'installers' sub-folder.

# Sub-folder NECN data

Contains all the files and maps necessary to run the 'NECN' scenarios.

The scenario is defined by this file:  scenario_FB.txt
To run the scenario, use this batch file:  BatchFile.bat

# Sub-folder PnET data


# Sub-folder Fire Data

Contains the data necessary to run three unique fire scenarios (2,3,5 year rotations across the majority of the landscape).  Original (3-year rotation) data provided by Ft. Bragg Natural Resources.

# Sub-folder Harvest Data

Contains the data necessary to simulate Business-as-Usual harvesting across the Ft. Bragg landscape, as determined in collaboration with Ft. Bragg Natural Resources

# Sub-folder HighTemp_HighPrecip_2_HAD

Contains the climate data for the high temperature and HIGH precipitation scenario.

# Sub-folder HighTemp_LowPrecip_20_BCC

Contains the climate data for the high temperature and LOW precipitation scenario.

# Sub-folder Landscape_GIS_files

Original shape file of the Ft. Bragg landscape.
