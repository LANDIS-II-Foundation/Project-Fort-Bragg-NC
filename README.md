# Project-Fort-Bragg-NC

Model inputs for Ft. Bragg simulations of climate change, hurricanes, and management.  This research was funded by the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP)(Project #: RC-201702). The Ft. Bragg Natural Resources Team was instrumental in the development and delivery of this data:  Rod Fleming, Jason Monroe, T. Kevin Crawford.  Project co-PIs include:  Drs. Melissa Lucash, Robert Scheller, and Matthew Duveneck.

The final report with further detail is a PDF in this directory:  "ESTCP RC-201702 Final Report.PDF"  
Final publications are: 
Shrum et al. 2020. Base-Hurricane. Ecological Modeling and Software. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104833
Lucash et al. 2022. Managing for red‚Äêcockaded woodpeckers is more complicated under climate change. The Journal of Wildlife Management http://doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.22309 

The purpose of this repository is to allow fast and efficient reproduction of the results that have been delivered to ESTCP and Ft. Bragg.  Requirements for re-running the models and scenarios include:
* Installation of the LANDIS-II model (see http://www.landis-ii.org/home) and the extensions (see the 'installers' sub-folder)
* Copy all the material in the 'Model Inputs' sub-folder to a local computer.
* Scenario/Simulation extension options include succession (NECN and PnET), fire, hurricane, and harvest.
* Launch the scenarios using the included batch file.

Analysis of model outputs requires installation of the R statistical package.  Example scripts have been provided in the 'scripts' sub-folder.

Questions and concerns about model inputs should be directed to Dr. Melissa Lucash
